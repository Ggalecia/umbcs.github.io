title: "Understanding Imposter Syndrome in UMass Boston STEM Students"
---

Do you ever doubt your abilities despite your achievements?

You’re not alone. Imposter Syndrome is the feeling of self-doubt or unworthiness despite evident success—affects many STEM students. We are three IT/CS students conducting a research project to better understand how Imposter Syndrome impacts students like you at UMass Boston, with guidance from Professor Amanda Potasznik.

**Why is this important?**

We aim to explore how factors such as gender, race, and academic year influence these feelings among STEM students. Your participation will help us gain valuable insights into these issues.

**Your participation matters!** Take a quick 3-minute survey to contribute to this important research.
