<p>Abstract: Abstract: AI systems play a critical role in shaping the information environment, moderating content, and influencing digital interactions. However, as AI assumes these responsibilities, it also becomes a target of attack, raising new challenges at the intersection of security and generative AI. This talk explores the evolution of AI security, from defending against adversarial manipulation of moderation systems to leveraging generative AI for content moderation, and ultimately to red-teaming AI itself to uncover new vulnerabilities.</p>
