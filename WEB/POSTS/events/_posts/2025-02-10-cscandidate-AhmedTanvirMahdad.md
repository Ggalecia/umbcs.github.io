<p><b>Abstract:</b> Emerging mobile platforms, such as modern smartphones and AR/VR devices, bring new challenges in user verification, data protection, and user privacy. In terms of user verification and data protection, it is important to analyze modern authentication systems that use emerging platforms (e.g., smartphones) and state-of-the-art protocols (e.g., FIDO2) to implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) systems. To address this, we developed a novel attack framework and evaluated these authentication systems, uncovering vulnerabilities in all of them. Moreover, to explore user privacy risks on these emerging platforms, we analyzed side-channel vulnerabilities exploiting built-in zero-permission motion sensors of smartphones and AR/VR devices, revealing potential severe privacy leaks. Additionally, we leverage this side-channel information to develop potential defenses against known threats, such as unwanted robocalls and better AR/VR authentication systems.
