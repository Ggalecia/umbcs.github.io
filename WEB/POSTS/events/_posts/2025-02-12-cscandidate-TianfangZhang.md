<p><b>Abstract: </b>Next-generation (NextG) computing is transforming traditional paradigms by integrating emerging technologies across diverse domains, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While these advancements enable a wide range of innovative applications, they also introduce significant security and privacy risks, such as sensitive data leakage and stealthy cyber threats. Ensuring the trustworthiness of NextG computing has become a critical challenge for the safe deployment of future applications.
